  pull_request: What:                /sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/level
Date:                March 2007
KernelVersion:        2.6.21
Contact:        >
Description:
                Each USB device directory will contain a file named
                power/level.  This file holds a power-level setting for
                the device, either "on" or "auto".

                "on" means that the device is not allowed to autosuspend,
                although normal suspends for system sleep will still
                be honored.  "auto" means the device will autosuspend
                and autoresume in the usual manner, according to the
                capabilities of its driver.

                During normal use, devices should be left in the "auto"
                level.  The "on" level is meant for administrative uses.
                If you want to suspend a device immediately but leave it
                free to wake up in response to I/O requests, you should
                write "0" to power/autosuspend.

                Device not capable of proper suspend and resume should be
                left in the "on" level.  Although the USB spec requires
                devices to support suspend/resume, many of them do not.
                In fact so many don't that by default, the USB core
                initializes all non-hub devices in the "on" level.  Some
                drivers may change this setting when they are bound.

                This file is deprecated and will be removed after 2010.
                Use the power/control file instead; it does exactly the
                same thing.

Description:        The integer value of this attribute ranges from 0-4.
                When read, this attribute returns the number of the actual

                profile that's active when the mouse is powered on next time.
                When written, this file sets the number of the startup profile
                and the mouse activates this profile immediately.

Description:        This is a symlink: /sys/o2cb to /sys/fs/o2cb. The symlink is
                removed when new versions of ocfs2-tools which know to look
                in /sys/fs/o2cb are sufficiently prevalent. Don't code new
                software to look here, it should try /sys/fs/o2cb instead.
Users:                ocfs2-tools. It's sufficient to mail proposed changes to
                ocfs2-devel@oss.oracle.com. }}

Date:                May 2010 (scheduled), finally removed in kernel v2.6.37
Contact:        linux1394-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
Description:
        /dev/raw1394 was a character device file that allowed low-level
        access to FireWire buses.  Its major drawbacks were its inability
        to implement sensible device security policies, and its low level
        of abstraction that required userspace clients to duplicate much
        of the kernel's ieee1394 core functionality.
        Replaced by /dev/fw*, i.e. the <linux/firewire-cdev.h> ABI of
        firewire-core.

Description:
        /dev/video1394/* were character device files, one for each FireWire
        controller, which were used for isochronous I/O.  It was added as an
        alternative to raw1394's isochronous I/O functionality which had
        performance issues in its first generation.  Any video1394 user had
        to use raw1394 + libraw1394 too because video1394 did not provide
        asynchronous I/O for device discovery and configuration.
        Replaced by /dev/fw*, i.e. the <linux/firewire-cdev.h> ABI of
        firewire-core.
